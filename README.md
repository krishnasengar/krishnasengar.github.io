# Actor/Model Portfolio Template 1 (Web Pages)
A basic, multi-page, actor/model portfolio template app with minimal design from Bootstrap. This template contains multiple files for navigation.

## Purpose
The purpose of this template is to already have a basic portfolio website made for an actor/model to lessen time to build from scratch, allowing users to spend less time architecting and styling, and more time adding images, bios, new updates, etc.
